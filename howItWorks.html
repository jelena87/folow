Now you can, with folow you can post publicly or via contact groups, this could be just friends, family, work colleagues or specific people, allowing you to control whats seen by who. If that wasn't enough you can also share content with one or more profiles to save doubling up on posts such as holiday photos or projects.</p>

          <h2>Your Folows can make a difference</h2>
          <p>When you see campaigns such as new ideas/inventions or good causes for making change or donations it's always harder to get the voice out there as the networks that host these are separate to the social networks they rely on and the cost of getting the message out there can kill the chances of success, with folow you can create campaigns and causes simply and allow you folows and subscribers help directly through the platform where simply clicking a button can help raise funds for an array of innovative or community projects to petitions and donation for charitable or political reasons.</p>
